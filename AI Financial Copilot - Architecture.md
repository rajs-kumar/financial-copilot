# AI Financial Copilot - Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The AI Financial Copilot application is designed with a modular, scalable architecture that leverages specialized AI agents to provide financial insights, transaction categorization, and natural language interaction capabilities.

### Architectural Layers

#### 1. Client Layer (Frontend)
While not part of this codebase, the system is designed to work with:
- A responsive web application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Mobile applications via the REST API
- Future integration possibilities with third-party financial applications

#### 2. API Gateway & Service Layer
- Express.js REST API with TypeScript
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Input validation and request sanitization
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Organized into modular routes and controllers

#### 3. Agent Orchestration Engine
- Manages the lifecycle of multiple specialized AI agents
- Coordinates communication between agents using a message queue
- Handles agent state and recovery
- Provides monitoring and logging of agent activities

#### 4. Data Storage Layer
- PostgreSQL for structured data (user profiles, transactions, accounts)
- Vector search capabilities for semantic matching
- Properly indexed for performance
- Transactional integrity with proper constraints

#### 5. External Integrations
- LLM API integration for natural language understanding
- File parsing capabilities for financial document ingestion
- Designed for future integrations with Open Banking APIs

### Core Components

#### AI Agents System
The application is built around a multi-agent architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion Agent**
   - Processes uploaded financial documents (CSV, PDF)
   - Extracts structured transaction data
   - Maps transactions to the Chart of Accounts
   - Ensures data quality and consistency

2. **Transaction Categorization Agent**
   - Automatically categorizes transactions
   - Uses both rule-based and LLM-based approaches
   - Improves over time with user feedback
   - Provides confidence scores for categorizations

3. **Copilot Chat Agent**
   - Processes natural language queries about finances
   - Generates personalized responses and insights
   - Analyzes transaction patterns and financial health
   - Handles follow-up questions and context-aware conversations

4. **Monitoring Agent** (Future)
   - Monitors financial activity for anomalies
   - Alerts users to unusual transactions or patterns
   - Tracks recurring expenses and subscription charges
   - Identifies opportunities for savings

#### Message Queue System
- Provides asynchronous communication between agents
- Ensures reliable message delivery
- Supports persistent message storage
- Fallback mock implementation for development environments

#### LLM Integration
- Abstracts interaction with language model APIs
- Provides consistent interface regardless of underlying LLM
- Handles prompts, context management, and response parsing
- Includes fallback mechanisms and error handling

### Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure password handling with bcrypt
   - Session management

2. **Data Security**
   - Secure file handling and validation
   - Input sanitization and validation
   - Parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities

3. **API Security**
   - Helmet middleware for HTTP security headers
   - CORS protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation

### Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - User registers or logs in
   - Authentication service validates credentials
   - JWT token issued for subsequent API calls

2. **Data Ingestion Flow**
   - User uploads financial documents
   - Files validated and stored securely
   - Data Ingestion Agent processes files asynchronously
   - Extracted transactions stored in database
   - Transaction Categorization Agent processes new transactions

3. **Transaction Management Flow**
   - User queries transactions
   - Filtering and pagination applied
   - Transactions returned with categorization metadata
   - User can manually adjust categorizations
   - System learns from user corrections

4. **Copilot Chat Flow**
   - User sends natural language query
   - Query processed by Copilot Chat Agent
   - Agent retrieves relevant financial data
   - LLM generates personalized response
   - Insights extracted and stored for future reference

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless API design allows multiple server instances
   - Database connection pooling
   - Message queue enables distributed processing

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database indexing strategy
   - Query optimization
   - Caching opportunities
   - Asynchronous processing for compute-intensive tasks

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Error tracking and reporting
   - Performance metrics
   - Agent activity monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with vector search capabilities
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ (with mock implementation for development)
- **AI/ML**: Integration with LLM APIs (OpenAI or similar)

   - More sophisticated financial insights
   - Predictive analytics for cash flow
   - Personalized financial advice

2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Open Banking API integration
   - Investment account connections
   - Receipt scanning and processing

3. **Advanced Visualization**
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Financial health dashboards
   - Goal tracking visualizations

4. **Expanded Agent Capabilities**
